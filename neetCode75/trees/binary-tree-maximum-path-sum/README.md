Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

Given the root of a non-empty binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes has an edge connecting them. A node can not appear in the sequence more than once. The path does not necessarily need to include the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3]

Output: 6

Explanation: The path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

Example 2:

Input: root = [-15,10,20,null,null,15,5,-5]

Output: 40

Explanation: The path is 15 -> 20 -> 5 with a sum of 15 + 20 + 5 = 40.

Constraints:

    1 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 1000.
    -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
