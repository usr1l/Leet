Set Matrix Zeroes

Given an m x n matrix of integers matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.

You must update the matrix in-place.

Follow up: Could you solve it using O(1) space?

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [
  [0,1],
  [1,0]
]

Output: [
  [0,0],
  [0,0]
]

Example 2:

Input: matrix = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,0,5],
  [6,7,8]
]

Output: [
  [1,0,3],
  [0,0,0],
  [6,0,8]
]

Constraints:

    1 <= matrix.length, matrix[0].length <= 100
    -2^31 <= matrix[i][j] <= (2^31) - 1
